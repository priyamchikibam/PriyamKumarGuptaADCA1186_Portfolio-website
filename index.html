			<h3> Mother Moth </h3>
			<p> A minimalistic pixel art rendition of a moth. </p>
			<img class = "projectimages" src = "assets/Mother Moth.jpg" alt = "Mother Moth">
			<pre><i>
			In twilight's gentle hue, a moth takes flight.
				Wings fragile, whispers in the dimming light.
			Seeking solace in the moon's soft embrace.
				A lonely flutter in an endless space.
			
			Drawn to flickering flames, a tempting sight.
				Yearning for warmth on a lonesome night.
			Yet shadows dance, elusive and aloof.
				A solitary quest for love's reproof.
			</i></pre>

		<div class = "projects">
